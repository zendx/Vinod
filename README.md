# Vinod
 
Vinod is a WordPress plugin developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/henryshedrach">Henry Shedrach</a> to enable the users to upload PowerPoint or PDF document and the script automatically uses the first slide as a Wordpress Featured image.

#HOW IT WORKS
Once users upload the file (PDF or PowerPoint) The first slide or first page is automatically extracted and converted as jpg and used as a Wordpress featured image for the blog section upon submission.
